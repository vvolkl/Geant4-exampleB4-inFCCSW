# Geant4 Example B4 in FCCSW

This example shows how the Geant example B4 would be expressed in the FCC Framework, using some of
the available Gaudi components. Run with `gaudirun.py B4d/options/b4_example_gaudi.py` after having
built and installed the project with cmake (Note: if you install in a non-standard location, you
will have to make sure that `$installdir/lib:$installdir/python` are part of `PYTHONPATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` )
